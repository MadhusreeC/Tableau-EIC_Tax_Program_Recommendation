# Recommendation of Earned Income Credit tax program using Tableau
 This project is done for **Simplify CT/ SVP Consulting**

**Aim**:
In this project, analysis of publicly available data from the IRS and US Census Bureau for all the zip codes in Connecticut and identification of the zip codes which are in highest need of promotion of the program Earned Income Credit (EIC) are done through interactive maps using Tableau. 

**Methodology**:
The ratio of requirement was calculated by : <br />
i) The numerator of the ratio is the number of returns per income band per zip code. <br />
ii) The denominator of the data had the total population and the percentage per income band. <br />

Excel was used to calculate the number of households per income band. Matching of the common zip codes in both the data sources were done using VLOOKUP. The articulated datasource was imported in Tableau and interactive map dashboards were used to visualize the requirement.
