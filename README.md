# Recommendation of Earned Income Credit tax program using Tableau
 This project is done for **Simplify CT/ SVP Consulting**

**Aim**:
In this project, we analyzed publicly available data from the IRS and US Census Bureau for all the zip codes in Connecticut and identified the zip codes which are in highest need of promotion of the program Earned Income Credit (EIC) through interactive maps using Tableau. 

**Methodology**:
For the numerator we aggregated the number of returns per income band per zip code. For the denominator the data had the total population and the percentage per income band. We used excel to calculate the number of households per income band. To collect the common zip codes in both the data sources, we used VLOOKUP in excel. Then we imported the articulated datasource in Tableau and created the interactive map dashboards using Tableau.
